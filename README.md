# Overview

## Project Goals 
1. Collect large datasets of tweets judged to be partisan
2. Conduct an initial bag-of-words analysis on these datasets
3. Train a transformer NLP model on the collected data
4. Verify the performance of the model and test on other data
5. Create a tool with the model that can be used by a non-programmer

## Part 1
The first part of this project was collecting the data. The notebook that was used to collect the data for this project can be found at `Notebooks and Scripts/tweet_scraping.pynb`.
